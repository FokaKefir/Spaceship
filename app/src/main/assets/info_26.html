  <h1>Apollo program</h1>

  <p>
    The Apollo program, or also known as Project Apollo, was the third human spaceflight program carried out the
    National
    Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which succeeded in preparing and landing the first humans on the Moon
    from
    1968 to 1972.

  <p>
    The first crewed flight was Apollo 7 and saw resumption of human spaceflight by the agency after the fire that
    killed
    the three Apollo 1 astronauts during a launch rehearsal test on January 27, 1967. The three astronauts were
    originally
    designed or the second crewed Apollo flight, and then backups for Apollo 1.

    Kennedyâ€™s goal was accomplished on the Apollo 11 mission, when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed
    their
    Apollo Lunar Module (LM) on July 20, 1969, and walked on the lunar surface, while Michael Collins remained in lunar
    orbit in the command and service module (CSM). All three astronauts have landed safely on Earth on July 24th. After
    this
    mission, five subsequent Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon. The last Apollo mission was Apollo 17,
    and
    it was completed in December 1972. These six spaceflights gave chance for twelve people to walk on the surface of
    the
    Moon.
