  <h1>Satellites</h1>

  <p>
    A satellite is an object that has been intentionally placed into orbit. These objects are called artificial
    satellites
    to distinguish them from natural satellites such as Earthâ€™s Moon.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first artificial satellite was Sputnik 1. It was launched by the Soviet Union into orbit on October 4th, 1957.
  </p>

  <p>
    Satellites have multiple purposes, like Earth observation, communication support, navigation support, weather
    observation and prediction, and space telescopes. Space stations (like the Mir, the International Space Station and
    Tiangong space station) are also considered artificial satellites.
