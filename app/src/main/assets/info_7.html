  <h1>Electricity</h1>

  <p>
    Electricity is the ordered movement of charge carriers, in this case electrons. It is a secondary energy source,
    which
    means that we harvest it from the conversion of other sources of energy, like coal, natural gas, or nuclear power,
    which
    are primary sources. Electricity is one of the most widely used forms of energy.

  <p>
    There are three things that we must consider while working with electricity: current, voltage, and resistance.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        a. Current is the movement of charge carriers (electrons) through a point over a unit of time and it is measured
        in
        amperes (A).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        b. Voltage is an electromotive force (pressure from a power source) which makes the electrons move in a
        conductor. The
        higher the force, the electrons will move faster. Voltage is measured in volts (V).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        c. Resistance is the force which resists the movement of electrons in the conductor. Higher resistance means we
        need to
        put more energy into the circuit to make the electrons move. It is measured in Ohms (Ω).
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    These properties are well described by Ohm’s law, which states that the current is proportional to the potential
    difference (voltage) and inversely proportional to the resistance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Electricity only flows in closed circuits, so that means there must be no interruptions in the circuit (for example
    open
    switches or breaks in the cables). We must consider a few things when it comes to open circuits, if the potential
    difference (voltage) is high enough between two points in the circuit, an arc can form which causes the atoms in the
    surrounding air to lose its electrons thus becoming a conductor, so the circuit will close. We need protection
    against
    this issue, so engineers use insulators for this. If there’s a break in the insulator, arcing can occur as well.
