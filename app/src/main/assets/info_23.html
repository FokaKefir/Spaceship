  <h1>Milky Way</h1>

  <p>
    We live in a galaxy, called the Milky Way, which includes our Solar System. Its name describes the galaxy’s
    appearance,
    which can be seen with the naked eye on a very clear sky and without light pollution but is just barely noticeable.
    It
    is seen as a milky disk-shaped structure because it’s viewed from within. There is a black hole in the centre of our
    galaxy, called Sagittarius A*, which has a mass of 4.1 million times of the Sun’s.
