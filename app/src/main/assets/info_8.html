  <h1>Air pressure</h1>

  <p>
    Let’s imagine that you hold a stack of tennis balls in your hands, you feel its pressure on your hand. Now imagine
    adding more tennis balls, this force becomes higher and higher the higher the tennis ball column gets. We can
    imagine
    something similar when it comes to air pressure.
  </p>

  <p>
    Right now, there’s a tall column of air on top of you which pushes on you from all directions. Usually we don’t feel
    this force, because we are used to it, but we can feel its absence.
  </p>

  <p>
    Imagine the following situation: you have a syringe in your hand, and you fully retract it, now the syringe is
    filled
    with air. You put the tip of the syringe on the palm of your other hand, and you try to push the plunger of the
    syringe
    and you will feel that pressure building up on your hand. Now you try releasing that pressure and you will feel the
    air
    inside the barrel pushing against your finger. Now try the reverse, you push the plunger all the way in, and when
    you
    put it on your hand you retract it. You will feel a suction, and that suction comes from the surrounding air pushing
    on
    your hand.
