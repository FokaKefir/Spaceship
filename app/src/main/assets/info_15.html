  <h1>Stars</h1>

  <p>
    If the weather is clear, you can see stars in the sky almost every night! Stars are the most widely recognized
    astronomical objects and represents the most fundamental building blocks of galaxies. Currently there is a star in
    the
    centre of our solar system, and we call it the “Sun”.

    Stars are born within the clouds of dust and scattered throughout most galaxies. Turbulence deep within these clouds
    gives rise to knots with sufficient mass that the gas and dust can begin to collapse under its own gravitational
    attraction. As this cloud collapses, the material at the centre begins to heat up. This is known as a “protostar”,
    which
    is this hot core at the heart of the collapsing cloud that will one day become a star.

    Stars work by fusing atoms in their cores to make heat and light. This means that atoms of hydrogen are slammed
    together
    under high heat and pressure, resulting in a helium atom. Fusion releases heat and light, that we take the advantage
    of
    on Earth. This process is called “stellar nucleosynthesis”, and it is the source of many of the elements in the
    universe
    heavier than hydrogen and helium.

    The next milestone in a star’s life depends on its own mass because it will determine how it will end. A relatively
    low-mass star, like our Sun, has different ate from stars with higher masses. It will blow off its outer layers,
    creating a planetary nebula with white dwarf in the middle. On the other hand, high-mass stars have a short
    lifespan.
    The core of the original tar is left behind as the rest of its material is thrown into space. This results in a
    nebula.
