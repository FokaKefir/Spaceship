  <h1>Solar panels</h1>

  <p>
    Solar panels, or also called a photo-voltaic modules, use the light energy from the Sun to generate electricity
    through
    the photovoltaic effect. The photovoltaic effect is the generation of voltage and electric current in a material
    upon
    exposure to light. This effect is closely related to the photoelectric effect, in which photons knock electrons out
    from
    their orbitals, becoming free electrons and thus creating an electric voltage potential difference.

  <p>
    There are three types of solar panels:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Mono crystalline</li>
    <li>Poly crystalline</li>
    <li>Thin-film solar panels</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Each of these types is made in a unique way and have a different appearance. Their efficiency varies from the type
    of
    the solar panel, but the best achieved solar module efficiency is around 21.5%.
