  <h1>Meteoroids</h1>

  <p>
    Meteors are objects in space that range in size from dust grains to small asteroids. People like to call them “space
    rocks”. When meteoroids enter a planet’s atmosphere at high velocity and burn up, the fireballs (or also called
    “shooting stars”) are called meteors. When a meteoroid survives a trip through the atmosphere and falls on the
    ground,
    it is called a meteorite.
