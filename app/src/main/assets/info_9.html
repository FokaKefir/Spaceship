  <h1>Heating and cooling systems</h1>

  <p>
    Heating and cooling systems is used for temperature regulations within the spacecraft, or any kind of space. This is
    very important for life support. Without temperature regulations you can easily get hypothermia if the environment
    is
    too cold, or you could overheat and get fever-like symptoms, sometimes it can get a humanâ€™s life in danger.

  <p>
    These kinds of systems have three basic elements, a source of warm or cool air, a method of sending the heated or
    cooled
    air into a living space and a way to control the temperature. A heating system consists of a furnace, a boiler, a
    heat
    pump, fan coils, ducts, packaged products, and a thermostat. These parts are responsible for heating. A cooling
    system
    consists of an air conditioner, heat pump, fan coils, ducts, evaporator coils, packaged products, and a thermostat.
    These parts are responsible for cooling.
