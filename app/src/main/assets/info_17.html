  <h1>Temperature in space</h1>

  <p>
    In space, the particle density is very low, so there are not a lot of particles that can bump into each other and
    make
    themselves get into a more excited state, so the temperature in space is very low. The average temperature in space
    is
    2.7 Kelvins (K) above absolute zero (-273.15 Â°C).
