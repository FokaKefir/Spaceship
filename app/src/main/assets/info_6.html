  <h1>Inertia</h1>

  <p>
    Inertia is the resistance of any physical object to any change in its velocity. This includes changes to the
    objectâ€™s
    speed, or direction of motion. An aspect of this property is the tendency of objects to keep moving in a straight
    line
    at a constant speed when no forces act upon them.
