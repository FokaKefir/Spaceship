  <h1>Rocket technology</h1>

  <p>
    A rocket is a spacecraft, aircraft, vehicle, or projectile that obtains thrust from a rocket engine. Rocket engine
    exhaust is formed entirely from propellant carried within the rocket. Rocket engines work by action and reaction
    (Newton’s third law) and push rockets forward simply by expelling their exhaust in the opposite direction at high
    speed,
    and therefore it can work in the vacuum of space.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are many types of rockets, including tiny models such as balloon rockets, missiles, space rockets, rocket
    cars,
    rocket bike, etc…
  </p>

  <p>
    There is an important equation that describes the theoretical total change in velocity that a rocket can achieve
    without
    any external interference (without air drag or gravity or other forces). This is called Delta-V.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are so called “multistage rockets” which is optimized for fuel consumption and the rocket will get rid of its
    own
    dead weight (weight that is useless, and it contributes to more fuel usage). This is done by having multiple stages
    on a
    rocket. Once a stage fully runs out of fuel, it detaches from the rocket and usually falls back to Earth, where it
    is
    either burned up in the atmosphere, or it is landed in a safe manner.
