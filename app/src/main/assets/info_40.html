  <h1>Communication system</h1>

  <p>
    NASA have put up a system called the NASA Deep Space Network, which is an international network of antennas that
    provide
    the communication links between the scientists and engineers on Earth to the mission in space and on Mars. It
    consists
    of three deep-space communications facilities placed approximately 120 degrees apart around the world. This
    strategic
    placement permits constant observation of spacecraft as the Earth rotates on its own axis.
