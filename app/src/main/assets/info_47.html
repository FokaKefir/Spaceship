  <h1>DNA</h1>

  <p>
    Deoxyribonucleic acid (or DNA) is a molecule composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to
    form a
    double helix. The DNA carries genetic information for the development, functioning, growth and reproduction of all
    known
    organisms and many viruses.
