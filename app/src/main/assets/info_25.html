  <h1>First spacecrat</h1>

  <p>
    The first artificial satellite was the Sputnik 1 spacecraft which was successfully placed in orbit around the Earth
    in
    1957, and it was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome at Tyuratam in Kazakhstan, the part of the former Soviet Union.
    The
    Russian word “Sputnik” means “companion”, or in the astronomical sense “satellite”.

    The Sputnik 1 satellite was a 58-centimetre diameter aluminium sphere that carried four whip-like antennas that were
    2.4-2.9 metres long.
