  <h1>Thrusters and reaction-control systems</h1>

  <p>
    If we want to keep a rocket on its calculated path, we need to have some kind of system put in place to have control
    over its attitude, that is its orientation in space. We can achieve this by using thrusters and reaction-control
    systems. Thrusters are low thrust “engines” which have control over the spacecraft’s attitude, these are also
    referred
    as reaction-control thrusters. Another method of achieving stabilization is to use electrically powered reaction
    wheels
    (or also called momentum wheels). These wheels are mounted in three orthogonal axes aboard the spacecraft. They
    provide
    a means to trade angular momentum back and forth between the spacecraft and wheels. If you want to rotate the
    spacecraft
    in a direction, you have to spin the wheel into the opposite direction.
