  <h1>Tiangong space station</h1>

  <p>
    The Tiangong space station is a space station being constructed by China in low Earth orbit (LEO) between340 and 450
    kilometres above the surface. This is China’s first long-term space station, it is the goal of the “Third Step” of
    the
    China Manned Space Program (also known as Project 921). Once it is completed, it will have a mass between 80 and 100
    tons, which is around one-fifth the mass of the International Space Station, and about the same size of the
    decommissioned Russian Mir space station but with more advanced technologies.
