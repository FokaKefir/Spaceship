  <h1>On-Board Computers (OBCs)</h1>

  <p>
    Computers are necessary for the spacecraft to function, and it makes communication possible. There are lots of
    challenges that engineers have to face when designing an on-board computer for a spacecraft. One obstacle is
    background
    radiation. Radiation can cause computers to malfunction or behave unexpectedly. One stray particle could interact
    with a
    transistor inside a circuit, or it could strike a sensitive node in a micro-electronic device, and could cause it to
    change state, thus resulting in a bit flip. These events are called “single-event upsets”, or SEUs.
  </p>

  <p>
    To combat this issue, engineers use multiple computers in synchronicity, doing the same calculations. If one
    computer is
    exposed to a SEU, causing an issue in a calculation, but the other two computers agree on the data, then the
    computer’s
    data which was exposed gets ignored. This is a reliable method, since the probabilities of the three computers
    experiencing an SEU at the exact same time is extremely low.
