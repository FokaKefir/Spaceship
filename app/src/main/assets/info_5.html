  <h1>Orbits</h1>

  <p>
    Every night you look up and see the Moon, you notice it is not at the same place every time. This has to do with the
    current rotation of the Earth, and the current position of the Moon as well. An orbit is a gravitationally curved
    trajectory of an object. The moon follows a specific orbit around the Earth. Usually, orbit refers to a regularly
    repeating trajectory, but it might also refer to a non-repeating trajectory. An orbit does not have to be a perfect
    circle, most of the orbits are elliptical with different eccentricities (how close it is to being a perfect circle).

    An apsis (or apsides) is the farthest or nearest point in the orbit of a planetary body. For example, the apsides of
    Earth’s orbit of the Sun are two: the aphelion (where Earth is farthest from the Sun) and the perihelion (where it
    is
    the nearest). These points can also be referred as “apoapsis/periapsis” or “apocenter/pericenter”. These kinds of
    motions can be described using Kepler’s laws.
