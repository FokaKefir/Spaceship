  <h1>Rocket Propulsion</h1>

  <p>
    If you want to go to orbit around Earth, you need a lot of fuel to make this possible. This is where rocket
    propulsion
    comes in. Without propulsion, you will not be going anywhere. Rocket propulsion is of vital importance for space
    travel
    and for launching satellites into orbits around a planet.

    A rocket has multiple stages, and each stage has its own propulsion system. A propulsion system includes all the
    parts
    which make up the rocket engine, the tank pumps, propellants, the power head, and rocket nozzle. There is propellant
    stored in the fuel tanks and with the help of tank pumps, we can get that fuel into the rocket engine, where it is
    ejected with high velocity.

    We can apply Newtonâ€™s third law here as well, we push the rocket propellant through the nozzle, and the propellant
    pushes back at the rocket with the same force, thus giving lift to the rocket.
