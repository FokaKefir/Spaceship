  <h1>Earth</h1>

  <p>
    Our planet, the Earth, is the third planet from the Sun in our Solar System. This is the only astronomical object
    known
    to support life. About 29.2% of Earth’s surface is land consisting of continents and islands, while the remaining
    70.8%
    is covered with water. Earth’s polar regions are covered in ice. Earth was formed around 4 and a half billion years
    ago.

  <p>
    The outer layer is divided into several tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years,
    while its interior remains active with a solid iron inner core and a liquid outer core, which is responsible for
    generating Earth’s magnetic field, and it’s also called the geomagnetic field. This magnetic field extends from the
    Earth’s interior out into space, where it interacts with solar wind, which is a stream of particles emanating from
    the
    Sun. Because of this, Earth’s magnetic field protects us from solar flares.
