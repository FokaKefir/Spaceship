  <h1>Our Solar System</h1>

  <p>
    The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, in this case planets,
    moons, asteroids, meteors, dwarf planets, etc… Our Solar System was formed around 4.6 billion years ago from the
    gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. Most of the system’s mass is in the Sun, with the
    majority of the remaining mass contained in Jupiter.

  <p>
    The asteroid belt occupies the orbit between Mars and Jupiter, between 2.3 and 3.3 AU, or 340 and 490 million
    kilometres, from the Sun. It is thought to be the remains from the Solar System’s formation that failed to coalesce
    because of the gravitational interference of Jupiter.
