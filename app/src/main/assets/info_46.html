  <h1>Bone and Muscle Loss in Microgravity</h1>

  <p>
    We have evolved with the constant pull of Earth’s gravity. They are used to constantly supporting the body’s weight,
    but
    without gravity, or in microgravity, they don’t have to support the body’s mass (weight on Earth). Because of this,
    astronauts in microgravity would experience bone and muscle loss or atrophy during their stay in orbit. By doing
    daily
    exercises (weightlifting, stretching, jogging, etc…) we can combat this issue. Bone and muscle atrophy also occurs
    from
    normal aging, sedentary lifestyles, and illnesses. This may cause serious health issues from injuries due to falls
    or
    osteoporosis for both astronauts and people on Earth.
