  <h1>Radio communication</h1>

  <p>
    When a spacecraft is in interstellar space, or in orbit around a planet, we must communicate with it. This
    communication
    is done using large radio towers on the ground. The spacecraft tries to communicate with the closest radio tower
    available for the best and reliable connectivity. Radio communication is done using radio waves, which is an
    electromagnetic wave (or radiation), which does not require a medium to travel through, like sound.
