  <h1>Speed of light</h1>

  <p>
    The speed of light in a vacuum, denoted “c” is a universal physical constant. This value is defined as 299.792.458
    meters per second (or approximately 300.000 kilometres per second). Since light is an electromagnetic wave, we can
    say
    that electromagnetic waves travel around this speed. Although the speed of light is commonly associated with
    electromagnetic radiation, it is also the speed at which massless particles and field perturbations travel in a
    vacuum,
    including gravitational waves (yes, gravity is a wave as well).
  </p>

  <p>
    Fun fact, it takes around 8 minutes and 20 seconds for the light to reach the Earth from the sun. This is because of
    the
    enormous distance between them, so by when you start seeing the Sun rise above the horizon, it is way above that.
