  <h1>Radiation</h1>

  <p>
    In physics, radiation is the emission of energy in the form of waves or particles through space or through a
    material
    medium. There are multiple types of radiation, which you might have heard of:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Electromagnetic radiation</li>
    <li>Particle radiation</li>
    <li>Acoustic radiation</li>
    <li>Gravitationl radiation</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You might have heard about light and photons. Light can behave like particles (photons) or like waves
    (electromagnetic
    wave). Electromagnetic radiation does not require a medium to travel. You might ask, how can be light both be a
    particle
    and a wave at the same time? Sadly, there is not enough time to explain this phenomenon, but we know this thanks to
    quantum mechanics. You can prove this particle-wave duality, with the “Double Slit” experiment, where you shoot
    particles at two slits close to each other, and you will see an interference pattern on a detector.

    Radiation is all around us, and it is present in space as well. We are concerned about radiation, because there are
    harmful kinds of radiations, which can cause serious damage when it comes to contact with tissue, or in any
    material.
    The most dangerous type of radiation is ionizing radiation, where electrons are stripped from its atom as the atom
    is
    accelerated in space to speeds approaching the speed of light. A lot of exposure to ionizing radiation can cause
    cancer,
    or even death. Protection against this radiation is crucial for space travel.
