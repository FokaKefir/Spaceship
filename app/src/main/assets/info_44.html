  <h1>Landing on Mars</h1>

  <p>
    Multiple Mars landings have been attempted, but only 10 of them were successful. The first successful Mars landing
    was
    done in 1971 by the Soviet Union, the mission’s name is Mars 3. As of May 2021, Soviet Union, United States, and
    China
    have conducted Mars landings successfully. There are a lot of obstacles that engineers have to face when designing a
    landing system, including the thinness of the Martian atmosphere, measurement o distance to surface, etc…
  </p>

  <p>
    There are many ways of achieving a successful landing on Mars, here are a few examples:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Using parachutes and thrusters</li>
    <li>Using parachutes and retro-rockets</li>
    <li>Using parachutes, retro-rockets and airbags</li>
    <li>Using arachutes and rocket-powered sky cranes</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    It takes about seven minutes from the spacecraft to enter Mars’ atmosphere and land on the planet. This is also
    called
    “Seven Minutes of Terror”. During these seven minutes, there is nothing that the engineers could do, because there
    is a
    delay in communication between Earth and the spacecraft. This delay depends on the distance from Earth to Mars,
    which
    varies during a year. This delay can take up to 3 to 22 minutes. Because of this, when Earth receives the signal
    that
    the spacecraft has entered the atmosphere, in reality the rover has already landed, or crashed into the surface.
