  <h1>Voyager 1 & 2 missions</h1>

  <p>
    The twin Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft are exploring where nothing from Earth has flown before. Continuing
    their
    more than 40-year journey since their 1977 launches, they are much farther away from Earth and the Sun than Pluto.
    In
    August 2012, Voyager 1 made the historic entry into interstellar space. Voyager 2enteredinterstellar space on
    November
    5, 2018. Both spacecraft are still sending scientific information about their surroundings through the Deep Space
    Network (DSN).

    Their primary mission was the exploration of Jupiter and Saturn. After making a string of discoveries there, the
    mission
    was extended. Voyager 2went on to explore Uranus and Neptune, and is still the only spacecraft to have visited those
    outer planets. The adventurers’ current mission, the Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM), will explore the outermost
    edge
    of the Sun’s domain, and beyond.
