  <h1>Electrical systems</h1>

  <p>
    On today’s interplanetary spacecraft, roughly between 300 Watts and 2.5 kilowatts of electrical power is required to
    supply all the computers, radio transmitters and receivers, motors, vales, data storage devices, etc… On a Mars
    mission,
    the need for electrical power increases. For achieving this, we could use solar panels and nuclear reactors to get
    energy from natural resources. For example, Mars rovers like Opportunity and Perseverance uses nuclear power to keep
    itself running and for temperature regulations. The material used for this is radioactive plutonium.
