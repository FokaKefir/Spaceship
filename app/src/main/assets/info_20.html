  <h1>Black holes</h1>

  <p>
    Black holes are a region of space where the gravity is so strong that nothing (no particles, or even electromagnetic
    radiation) can escape from it. In every galaxyâ€™s core there is a supermassive black hole, which keeps the entire
    galaxy
    together, with the help of dark matter.

    On the 10th of April 2019 the Event Horizon Telescope managed to photograph a black hole, this is the first image of
    a
    black hole ever captured. This black hole was the supermassive black hole at the core of supergiant elliptical
    galaxy
    Messier 87, with a mass about 7 billion times that of the Sun.
