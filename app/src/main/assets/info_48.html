  <h1>Effects of radiation on DNA</h1>

  <p>
    Without protection from Earthâ€™s magnetic field, we would be constantly bombarded with radiation. Radiation can
    destroy,
    or damage living tissue and cells. When this happens, you get Acute Radiation Syndrome (or ARS). The symptoms of ARS
    can
    start within minutes to days after the exposure to high doses of radiation and it can last up to several days and
    may
    come and go. The symptoms include loss of appetite, fatigue, fever, nausea, vomiting and possibly even seizures and
    coma. The treatment of ARS focuses on reducing and treating infections, maintaining hydration, and treating injuries
    and
    burns.
