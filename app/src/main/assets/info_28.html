  <h1>Mars rovers</h1>

  <p>
    Mars rovers are motor vehicles that travel across the surface of the planet Mars upon arrival. Rovers have many
    advantages over stationary landers. They can examine more territory, they can be directed to interesting features,
    they
    can place themselves in sunny positions to weather winter months, and they can advance the knowledge of how to
    perform
    very remote robotic vehicle control.

    Currently there are three active rovers on the surface of mars. The first one is Curiosity by NASA, which was
    launched
    on November 26th, 2011, and it landed at the Aeolis Palus, near Aeolis Mons. The second rover is Perseverance. It is
    a
    rover created by NASA and it was built upon the successful design of Curiosity. It was launched with the Mars 2020
    mission on July 30th, 2020. It landed on February 18th, 2021. It also carried a little friend, a Mars Helicopter
    called
    Ingenuity. The third, and most recent, rover that is active on Mars is Zhurong. It was launched with the Tianwen-1
    CNSA
    Mars mission on July 23rd. It dropped a remote selfie camera on June 1st, 2021.

    Sadly, there are rovers on the surface of mars which are no longer active, like Mars 3, Sojourner, Spirit and
    Opportunity.
