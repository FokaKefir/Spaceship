  <h1>Hubble Space Telescope</h1>

  <p>
    The Hubble Space Telescope (HST or Hubble) is a space telescope that was launched into low Earth orbit in 1990 and
    it
    remains in operation. It is one of the largest and most versatile, renowned both a vital research tool and as a
    public
    relations boon for astronomy.

  <p>
    Hubble features a 2.4 metre mirror, and its five main instruments observe the ultraviolet, visible, and
    near-infrared
    regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. It is the only telescope designed to be maintained in space by astronauts.
    Five
    Space Shuttle missions have repaired, upgraded, and replaced systems on the telescope, including all five of the
    main
    instruments. The telescope could last until 2030-2040.
