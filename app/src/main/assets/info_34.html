  <h1>Laika</h1>

  <p>
    Laika was a Soviet space dog who became one of the first animals in space, and the first animal to reach orbit
    around
    the Earth. Laika was selected to be the occupant of the Soviet spacecraft Sputnik 2 that was launched into low orbit
    on
    3 November 1957. Her recovery and survival were not planned, and she died of overheating or asphyxiation shortly
    before
    she was to be poisoned.
