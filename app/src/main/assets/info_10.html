  <h1>Water purifiers</h1>

  <p>
    Due to the increasing levels of pollution and the spread of water borne diseases, water purifiers are required for
    every
    household. There are many ways of purifying water. One of the most common ways of purifying water is called “reverse
    osmosis”, it is one of the most advanced technologies used today in purification.
  </p>

  <p>
    Reverse osmosis purification systems work by forcing water through a special membrane which eliminates impurities
    and
    particles from the water that might not be visible for the naked eye. These special membranes remove impurities
    based on
    their shape and size, so that means that particles larger than a H2O molecule cannot pass through the filters. These
    kinds of impurities may contain harmful chemicals, contaminants such as pesticides, viruses, microorganisms,
    bacteria,
    and many more.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some of the benefits of using reverse osmosis purifiers is that they are equipped to filter out lead, mercury,
    arsenic,
    chlorine, fluoride, and many more harmful substances. They use less energy compared to other purifiers, thus using
    less
    electricity. Maintaining a reverse osmosis purifier is simple, it does not require heavy maintenance.
