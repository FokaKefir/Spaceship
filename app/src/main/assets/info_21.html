  <h1>Mars</h1>

  <p>
    Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun, and the second smallest planet in the Solar System. Mars is also referred as
    the
    “Red Planet”, which is not wrong, because the planet’s surface has a reddish appearance. This reddish appearance is
    thanks to ferric oxides, which is a mineral phase of iron, on the surface of the planet.
  </p>

  <p>
    The distance from the Sun to Mars is about 227 million kilometres. It revolves around the sun every 687 days, and it
    rotates every 24.6 hours, which is nearly the same as Earth.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Martian atmosphere consists of primarily carbon dioxide. The atmosphere is very thin, unlike the Venusian
    atmosphere
    which is very thick. Because of its thinness, the planet is bombarded with cosmic rays, thus producing very little
    greenhouse effect. The atmospheric pressure is around 1-2% of Earth’s atmosphere. The planet’s temperature average
    about
    -62.78 °C. However, the temperature can range from around -140 °C to -56 °C.
