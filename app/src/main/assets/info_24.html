  <h1>Galaxies</h1>

  <p>
    A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter.
    Their
    size can range from dwarfs with just a few hundred million stars, to giants, with one hundred trillion stars, each
    orbiting its galaxyâ€™s centre of mass. Galaxies are categorized by their visual appearance, they can be elliptical,
    spiral, or irregular.

    The oldest galaxy ever discovered, as of March 2016, is GN-z11. It has a distance of 32 billion light-years from
    Earth,
    and it is seen as it existed about 400 million years after the Big Bang. This galaxy can be found in the
    constellation
    Ursa Major.
