  <h1>Oxygen Generation System</h1>

  <p>
    Currently there is a module called MOXIE (Mars Oxygen In-Situ Utilization Experiment) on the Perseverance Mars rover
    and
    its job is to produce oxygen from the Martian carbon-dioxide atmosphere. It is located on the front, right side of
    the
    rover. It weighs around 6.41 kilograms on Mars. It produces up to 10 grams of oxygen per hour. This is done by using
    solid oxide electrolysis. The moduleâ€™s goal is to produce at least 98% purity at a rate of 6-10 grams per hour.
