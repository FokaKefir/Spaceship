  <h1>Planets</h1>

  <p>
    When you look up at the sky you might be able to see some planets! Planets are celestial bodies moving in an
    elliptical
    orbit around a star. Currently, there are 8 planets in our solar system: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter,
    Uranus
    and finally Neptune. Sadly, in the International Astronomical Union (or IAU) has formally defined the term “planet”,
    thus excluding Pluto from planets, and it was reclassified as a “dwarf planet” in 2006.
