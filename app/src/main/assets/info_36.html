  <h1>Mir</h1>

  <p>
    Mir was a space station that operated in low Earth orbit from 1986 to 2001. It was operated by the Soviet Union and
    later by Russia. It was the first modular space station and was assembled in orbit from 1986 to 1996. At the time it
    was
    the largest artificial satellite in orbit, followed by the International Space Station after Mirâ€™s orbit decayed. It
    was
    deorbited in March 2001 after funding was cut off.
