  <h1>Gravity</h1>

  <p>
    You might have noticed that when you pick up an object and then let go, it falls, but why? This is thanks to
    gravity.
    Gravity, or gravitation, is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass or energy are attracted to one
    another.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every object that has a mass, has its own gravitational field which affects every object around it. The reason you
    don’t
    see objects getting closer and closer to each other as time passes, is because the gravitational force is weak and
    friction is a much stronger, so it stops objects from moving towards each other. This force keeps spacecrafts and
    celestial bodies in orbit around a planet, a star, or even a black hole.
  </p>

  <p>
    A gravitational field is technically infinite, so we can say that the player is currently in the app developers’
    gravitational field, but this force is so weak that it is negligible and can be considered zero. Fun fact, if you
    leave
    two tennis balls in space, it will take 4 days for them to come in contact due to the gravitational force between
    them.
